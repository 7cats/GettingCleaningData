This is the code book of the project
------------------------------------------------------
Variables includes:
1. Subjects
2. Activity
3. The rests are signal values, or features.


The variable Activity includes 6 activitities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying.
The variable subject ranges from 1 to 30, and each represents one experiment subject. The subjects are data from both test and training froups.
The rest variables are signals from the experiments. The meanSD.csv contains the means and standard deviations of dozens of signals measured by several experiments for both train and test groups. The aveMeanSD is the mean of both the mean and standard deviation of each signal, each subject and each activity.

There are in total 86 features in both datasets.
The information of the features, or the signals are copied from the raw dataset code book:
------------------------------------------------------
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
